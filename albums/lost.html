            You lie more than you breath

        <h3>6.) 42 - What You Bring</h3>
        <div class="lyric">Take a step to the left
            To realize what's right
            You know you don't act this way
            When you're out of sight
            You change who you are
            For anyone, for anything
            You should take a step back
            And decide what you want to bring
    
            Take a good look at this man
            Who doesn't even have a plan
            They tell him to be scared 
            And worried and full of fear
            But he seems relaxed 
            And patient and full of peace
            He has nothing to do
            He has nowhere to be
